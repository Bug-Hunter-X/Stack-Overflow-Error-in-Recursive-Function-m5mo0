This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a common recursive function error that leads to a stack overflow. The bug.js file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an improperly defined base case in the recursive function, leading to infinite recursion. The solution demonstrates how to correctly define the base case to prevent the stack overflow.
